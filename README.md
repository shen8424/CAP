## Introduction

We present <b>CAP</b>, a large-scale database including over 80k celebrities. Each celebrity in the CAP has three associated images along with their gender, birth year, occupation, and main achievements.

Two examples from CAP:

</div>

We provide the Python script `import_cap.py` that automatically integrates CAP information into your custom dataset by identifying all public celebrities mentioned in the textual content of each entry and incorporating their corresponding information.
## Quick start

### üîßFormat Requirements

- The file must be a **JSON array** (i.e., a list of objects).
- Every object must contain a `"text"` field.

### üìÑ Example JSON File

```json
[
  {
    "id": "001",
    "text": "Julian Assange leaving court after his application for bail Journalists tweeted updates while the hearing was in progress",
    "other_info": "...",
     "..."
  },
  {
    "id": "002",
    "text": "Little Mix and mentor Tommy Gunn were nt expecting to win The X Factor",
    "tags": ["example", "test"],
    "..."
  }
]
```

### ‚è¨ Download CAP

For the convenience of downloading and usage, we provide two download options for CAP: Hugging Face and Baidu Pan, which include folders `people_imgs1`, `people_imgs2` and the json file `cap_texts.json`. Please move all data from the two folders ( `people_imgs1` and `people_imgs2` ) into the `people_imgs` folder.  [CAP HF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SJJ0854/CAP) | [CAP Baidu Pan]()
